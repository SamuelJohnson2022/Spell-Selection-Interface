# Spell-Selection-Interface
This project was a scene I created in Unity that utilized C# scripts to create an interactive user interface where users are able to select four spells and see their stats.

You can run the project using the Spell Gear UI.exe found in the test build folder. (Just a warning - you have to use Alt + f4 or task manager to exit the test build)
